Hi guys, this is my first project for Shiny app related, it's basically a set of Shiny apps designed to help biologists with biodiversity monitoring and [species distribution mapping](https://github.com/danilyanedo7/shinyapp_species_distribution). The apps allow you to analyze biodiversity data and easily create interactive maps to visualize species distributions using Leaflet. While these tools are still a work in progress and could use some improvements, they provide a simple way for researchers to explore and understand their data. I hope these apps help make your biodiversity research a bit more accessible and engaging as I continue to refine them.

I am open for any project or coaching, let's [talk](/#contact)!
