As a mentor for undergraduate students, the overall goal of the mentoring project is to provide guidance and support to students in their academic and personal development. The objective of the project is to help students navigate their undergraduate years successfully and provide them with the resources they need to succeed in their chosen field of study.

The parameters of the mentoring project should be clearly defined and agreed upon by both the mentor and the student. This includes the frequency and duration of the mentoring sessions, the topics to be covered, and the expectations for both the mentor and the student. The mentor should also be available to the student outside of the mentoring sessions for additional support and guidance.

*  Define parameters of the mentoring project with the student
*  Provide guidance and advice on academic and personal matters
*  Help the student identify their strengths, weaknesses and interests
*  Help the student set goals for their academic and personal development
*  Assist the student in achieving their goals
*  Be available to the student outside of the mentoring sessions for additional support and guidance

In the past, I have had the privilege of mentoring several undergraduate students, including Fathoni Agung Nugraha and Sabila Fatimah. I covered several topics including international exposure, personal branding, and data analytics. Sabila was accepted as an [intern](https://www.its.ac.id/biologi/sabila-fatimah-enjoying-life-and-science-in-kumamoto-university-japan/) in Kumamoto University 2022 under Jasso Scholarship, and Fathoni succesfully develop [personal website](https://www.fathoniagung.com) and shared so many interesting stuff there. I cannot contribute so much to the society, but having this mentoring activity I wish to pay forward from what I get and hoping to see a better opportunity ahead for my surrounding. 

I would be gald to talk and discuss about interesting project about climate, community development and sociopreneurship. Hit me up through [this link](https://edodanilyan.com/#contact)!
