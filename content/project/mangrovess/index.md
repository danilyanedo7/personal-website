The Mangrove Sister School program is one of the programs that provides educational value to the surrounding community in the context of a mangrove restoration program with the Coastal and Marine Biodiversity Reserve concept which has been held by Pertaminas EP and Agrie Conservation in Lembung Paseser.

This program is dedicated to provide basic information related to the importance of mangrove ecosystem, its value and the biodiversity in it. We expect that the local people will be positively impacted by the existence of mangrove ecosystem. As we already know, in order to combat global warming, coastal forests remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, the majority of which is stored within the plant. Mangrove tree roots, branches, and leaves that die are typically buried by soil, which is subsequently submerged under tidal water, slowing down material decomposition and enhancing carbon storage. 

People who live near and in the surroundings of mangroves rely on them for a living. The trees produce a consistent source of wood for building and fuel, and are highly regarded for their tough resistance to decay and insects. However, commercial wood harvesting for pulp, wood chips, and charcoal has occurred in some regions, raising questions about sustainability. Locals gather plant extracts for their potential as medicines, while mangrove trees' leaves are frequently used as animal fodder. Local fisherman can find a plentiful supply of fish, crabs, and shellfish in the woodland waters to sell for a living. So, it's important to make sure that locals can live and rely on it in a sustainable manner.
