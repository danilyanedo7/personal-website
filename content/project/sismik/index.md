## Module Objectives
Explore various microbial samples collected from diverse environments, ranging from soil and water to unique ecological niches. Apply taxonomic principles to identify and classify these microorganisms using computational biology techniques in R Studio.

These module cover:
1. Dataset Preparation: Choose a set of diverse microbial species for phylogenetic analysis, considering different environments and taxonomic groups.
2. GenBank Data Retrieval: Access GenBank and retrieve genetic data for a diverse range of microbial species.
3. Sequence Alignment: Utilize bioinformatics tools to align the obtained DNA sequences, ensuring accurate comparisons and identification of conserved regions.
4. Phylogenetic Tree Construction: Employ phylogenetic tree-building algorithms to construct evolutionary trees based on the aligned sequences. Explore various methods, such as neighbor-joining or maximum likelihood, to understand their impact on tree topology.

These module only available in Bahasa Indonesia.
