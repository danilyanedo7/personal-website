Hi guys, biocomp is a repository for my bioinformatics and computational biology learning journey. This repository includes scripts and data primarily focused on computational biology, covering a wide range of topics such as:

Metagenomics: Tools and scripts for analyzing metagenomic data.
Phylogenetics: Methods for phylogenetic analysis and evolutionary studies.
Ecology: Scripts for ecological data analysis and visualization.
Data Visualization: Examples and tutorials on visualizing biological data effectively.
and many more
I am continuously updating this repository as I learn and explore more in the field of bioinformatics and computational biology. I would be very happy to receive comments or ideas, and I am also available for collaboration!

I am open for any project or coaching, let's [talk](/#contact)!
