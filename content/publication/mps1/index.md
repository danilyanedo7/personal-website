abstract: "In recent years, microplastics (MPs) have emerged as a prominent environmental problem in waters and environments, including lake waters. Microplastics in freshwater, such as those in floating net cages (FNC), can be consumed by Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus), one of the commercially available cultivated fish in Indonesia. This study aims to determine the prevalence of microplastics and compare their characteristics in the surface water, flesh, and gastrointestinal tract (GIT) of Nile Tilapia (O. niloticus) at Lake Ranu Grati, Pasuruan, East Java, Indonesia. Visual characteristics of MPs were observed using a stereo microscope, and polymers were analysed by ATR-FTIR (Attenuated Total Reflection-Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy). The abundance of MPs from water sample locations in Lake Ranu Grati reached 1116 MPs particles. In the water samples, the inner and outer sides of the FNC are dominated by the MPs with a size range of 251-500 µm and 1001-2000 µm in the milieu of Ranu Grati Lake. The most common MPs' types and colours are fibre and black, dominated by Polyethylene (PE). In 25 O. niloticus samples, 576 particles of MPs were found in the flesh fish and 724 particles in the gastrointestinal tract (GIT). This study found no significant variation in microplastic abundance between flesh and GIT samples (p>0.05; Mann-Whitney U test). Microplastics in Nile Tilapia flesh samples were dominated by blue fibres with a size range of 101-250 µm, and the polymer found was PA (polyamide). Meanwhile, in the GIT samples, microplastics were dominated by black fibre, with a size range of 251-500 µm, and the polymer found was PA (polyamide)."
