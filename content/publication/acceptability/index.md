abstract: "Skin is one of the abundance side products of the striped catfish (Pangasius hypophthalmus) fillet industry in tropical countries. The previous histological study revealed that the skin of striped catfish contains high collagens which has the potential to supply the increasing halal gelatin demands. However, the texture of striped catfish skin gelatin (SCSG) at room temperature is mushy. This can be enhanced by the transglutaminase (TG) modification. SCSG modified with TG (SCSG_TG) needs to be tested for safety and consumer acceptance before being marketed. The research aims to decide the level of acute toxicity of SCSG_TG in mice (Mus musculus) and discover the organoleptic quality of SCSG_TG. Striped catfish skin gelatin modified with transglutaminase (SCSG_TG) was acquire by CH3COOH (acid) and NaOH (base) extraction at a temperature of 58°C. Toxicity tests using mice were worked by the Limit Test Procedure of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and then analyzed descriptively and qualitatively. While organoleptic tests were worked using hedonic assessment and the Friedman test. The result shows SCSG_TG did not induce any toxic effects or death in mice. SCSG_TG 10 mg film was the most favored treatment group by the panelists (4.9-6.5) compared with SCSG_TG 0 mg (3.8-6.0) and SCSG_TG 50 mg film (4.1-6.3). Hence, the striped catfish skin gelatin film modified with transglutaminase (SCSG_TG) was declared safe, non-toxic, and accepted according to the organoleptic assessment that has met the standard (dislike criteria <25%)."
