ABSTRACT = {Melanoma is the most serious type of skin cancer, causing a large majority of deaths but accounting for only ~1% of all skin cancer cases. The worldwide incidence of malignant melanoma is increasing, causing a serious socio-economic problem. Melanoma is diagnosed mainly in young and middle-aged people, which distinguishes it from other solid tumors detected mainly in mature people. The early detection of cutaneous malignant melanoma (CMM) remains a priority and it is a key factor limiting mortality. Doctors and scientists around the world want to improve the quality of diagnosis and treatment, and are constantly looking for new, promising opportunities, including the use of microRNAs (miRNAs), to fight melanoma cancer. This article reviews miRNA as a potential biomarker and diagnostics tool as a therapeutic drugs in CMM treatment. We also present a review of the current clinical trials being carried out worldwide, in which miRNAs are a target for melanoma treatment.},
