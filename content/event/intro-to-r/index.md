A workshop on an introduction to R language for ecological research would provide a great opportunity for ecologists and other researchers to learn about the capabilities of R as a tool for data analysis and visualization. R is a powerful and widely used programming language in the field of ecology, and this workshop would provide a strong foundation in the basics of R, including data manipulation, statistical analysis, and visualization of ecological data. Participants in the workshop would be able to apply these skills to their own research and gain a better understanding of how R can be used to support ecological research.
