I’m excited to be a speaker at the 2024 STIC Webinar on Low Carbon Construction, where I’ll be presenting my work on using natural, local bacteria to strengthen ultra-low-carbon concrete. My talk, "Exploring Indigenous Bacteria to Improve Concrete Properties," will cover how these bacteria could help make concrete stronger and more durable, while also lowering its environmental impact. This approach could be a sustainable way to support the construction industry’s move toward greener practices.
