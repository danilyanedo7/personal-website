## Hey there!  

I’m **Edo Danilyan**, but feel free to call me **Edo**. I’m a PhD researcher at the University of Vienna, diving into the exciting world where microbiology meets data analytics and computational biology. My research focuses on unraveling the complexities of environmental microbiology using advanced data-driven approaches.  

Before starting my PhD journey, I honed my skills in project design, data analysis, and tool development while working on innovative projects during my undergraduate and graduate studies at [Institut Teknologi Sepuluh Nopember](https://www.its.ac.id). I love tackling tough problems and crafting practical solutions that make an impact.  

I’m also passionate about **R programming** and education. I create tutorials to help life science researchers make sense of their data using [R](https://github.com/danilyanedo7/biocomp) and build dynamic, interactive, and reproducible reports with R Markdown. Check out my [projects](/#projects) for examples of my work, browse through some of my [educational presentations](https://edodanilyan.com/post/dashboard_collection/), or explore my full [curriculum vitae](https://edodanilyan.com/uploads/resume.pdf).  

I’m always open to exciting collaborations and new challenges. If you’re looking to create something amazing, let’s connect! [Reach out](https://edodanilyan.com/#contact), and let’s see where our ideas can take us.
