I am **Edo Danilyan**, and you can call me **Edo**. I recently graduated with a Master’s degree in biology from institut Teknologi Sepuluh Nopember. I possess written communication skills in English, focusing on research protocols, research papers, and science communication (Writing samples can be accessed through https://edodanilyan.com/tag/publication/, and storytelling using data https://edodanilyan.com/post/dashboard_collection/). Additionally, I am proficient in environmental microbiology analysis in R to analyze and visualize microbial genomic and environmental data with several packages including ggplot2, plotly, flexdashboard, and many more. My ability extends to statistical analysis using R as well (Portfolio can be accessed through https://edodanilyan.com/post/portofolio/)  with a wide range of mathematical and statistical analysis ranging from algebra and mathematics, data distribution, data analytics, hypothesis testing, optimization, and probability in tidyverse package environment. In terms of wet lab activity, I am familiar with molecular biology techniques since my research [project](https://edodanilyan.com/#projects) employs a variety of molecular biology techniques such as PCR, RT-qPCR, DNA/RNA extraction, and gel electrophoresis. I am also familiar with primer design, plasmid construction, and gene expression in bacteria.

I am particularly interested in data analytics, computational biology, wildlife, conservation, biotechnology and the exploration of the potential of bacteria. Let's get in touch through my [contact](https://edodanilyan.com/#contact).
