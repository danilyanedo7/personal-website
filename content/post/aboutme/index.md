## Hey there!

I am **Edo Danilyan**, and you can call me **Edo**. I’m a PhD researcher at the University of Vienna, where I get to explore the fascinating intersections of microbiology, data analytics and computational biology. My work revolves around making sense of complex environmental microbiology data.

Before getting into this PhD journey, I gained skills in project design, data analysis, and tool development, working on projects that demanded both creativity and precision during my undergrad and grad study at the [Institut Teknologi Sepuluh Nopember](https://www.its.ac.id). I thrive on solving tough problems and finding practical solutions. 

I’m a passionate R user and educator. I make tutorial for life science researcher to make sense their data [using R](https://github.com/danilyanedo7/biocomp), and dynamic, interactive, reproducible reports using R Markdown. Browse my list of [projects](/#projects) for examples of my work, a selection of [educational presentations](https://edodanilyan.com/post/dashboard_collection/), or review my full [curriculum vitae](https://edodanilyan.com/uploads/resume.pdf).

I’m always on the lookout for exciting collaborations and new challenges, so feel free to [reach out](https://edodanilyan.com/#contact) if you want to create something amazing together! Let’s connect and see where our ideas can take us!
