Some of you might asked what kind of post this time, let me tell you one thing. The study abroad series will discontinued. 

You might find that I am bright, kind, full of positivity and so on and so  fort. I hate it when people see human as a black and white, we are grey with diffrent concentration of black and white. No, I am full of bullshit, I am afraid of many things, I am a coward maybe.

I fear disappointing my friends or facing their disapproval for choosing one party over the other. To avoid potential conflict or hurt feelings, I tell lies. I want to maintain positive relationships with everyone. By lying about my reasons for certain things, I hope to avoid any perceived favoritism or exclusion. I live with no other than loneliness, I fear of losing someone. My decision to lie may be influenced by societal norms that prioritize maintaining social harmony and avoiding confrontation. Or maybe I am just bad. I may convince myself that my lie is justified because I believe it's for the greater good of preserving my friendships and avoiding conflict. But, it's not the case. I am too dumb and i feel like more toward black color at this point. I feel like I don't deserve anyone.

I know that everyone made mistakes, but I made terrible ones. I hate to admit it that I want to live this world a lil bit longer. But I am afraid of dissapointing my family. I tried to build all the imposible dreams and expectation slowly and surely. I survived to make them happy, it's not for me. I lost all my hopes long time ago, I just live a life I dont want to live.

This is for my beloved friends Martin, Finda, Galuh, Izza, Biyu, Agung, Daris, Bayu, Yaya, Fahmi, and all of my friend I could not mention one by one. I slipped. I fail to be a good friend. I fail to meet your expectation. Oiya, tin, titip ya, you know everything that might be helpful for my family.

I said that I want to live my life to the fullest, I dont want to die before experiencing the beauty of Banda Naira, lost in other contries, kissing under the maple tree. But, I think i fail to see snow in Vienna, I fail to see some other rains in Bern, I fail to eat pizza in Italy. and some other dreams that I just had few years ago.

Plese let the doctoral school of UniVie know that I am not be able to start anything anymore, please.

Tante, adik selalu berusaha buat tante dan om seneng, kita sama sama berjuang melewati banyak hal. Tapi kali ini adik takut akan penolakan. Adik takut buat lihat tate dan om kecewa. Adik sudah lelah sama banyak hal. Maaf ya adik belum bisa jalan lebih jauh lagi, maafkan adik. Adik sayang sekali sama tante dan om.
