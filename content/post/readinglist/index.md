Hi everyone. It's been a long time right? I have been being so busy recently. 

1. Cosmos
Carl Sagan takes readers on a journey through the cosmos, exploring the wonders of the universe and the scientific principles behind it. This book explores almost everything about science, from the reflections of classical Greek philosophers on the signs of nature, how scientists' efforts to work in the Dark Age era to the Age of Enlightment. Sagan's work not only tells the development of science from time to time but also about how the beginning of the world was formed, life and death of a star, evolution to the role of humans to protect their environment. Humans are not only inhabitants of a planet called the earth but also have an important role in the evolution of other living things.
