## Overview

I primarily use R Studio IDE for [Exploratory Data Analysis](https://danilyanedo7.github.io/dashboard/), visualization and statistical analysis. I have extensive experience in data visualization and am proficient in a range of techniques and tools, including ggplot2, plotly, and ggstatsplot. I have successfully applied these skills to a variety of [projects]({{< relref "/project" >}}), from time series visualization and inferential statistics, to distribution and geospatial analysis. As a result, I am confident in my ability to effectively analyze and interpret data to support decision making and drive business results. I am available for designer, consultant, analyst, and workshop instructor in the field of data visualization and reproducible analysis.

 I am familiar with bioinformatics tools and databases, such as BLAST, GenBank, or UniProt, silva NGS, etc. Experience with analyzing and interpreting large biological datasets, such as genomics, proteomics, or transcriptomics data. My final project of undergraduate degree working with NGS (Next Generation Sequencing) method analysing microbiome profile based on mothur pipeline and silvaNGS database. I also have research experience in computational biology, including published [papers]({{< relref "/publication" >}}) or conference presentations in the field. Knowledge of statistics relevant to computational biology, such as linear regression or [clustering](https://danilyanedo7.github.io/praktikumsismikbits/). I also have experience with collaborating with biologists or other scientists to design and conduct computational biology experiments.

## Animated Visualization
This is best for presentation

## Interactive Plot
You can interact with this plot by pointing your cursor to the component of the plot. This allows users to interact with graphs on display, allowing for a better storytelling experience. Zooming in and out, point value display, panning graphs, etc. Being able to navigate through your visualizations smoothly plays a huge part in communicating data. Observe how easy it is to explain complicated data by using this type of plot. Compared to a static graph, this is miles ahead.
