## Overview

1. I mainly work on R Studio IDE for visualization and statistical analysis
2. For data visualization, I use ggplot2, plotly, & ggstatsplot package
3. I am able to work with many types of datasets and many types of chart including scatter plot, bar plot, box plot, line plot, heatmap, venn diagram, density plot, violoin plot, ridgeline, bubble plot, lollipop, tree map, dendogram, area, sankey plot, 3d modelling, interactive plot and animated plot
4. This portofolio contains time series visualization, inferencial statistics, distribution and geospatial visualization. 
5. I am available for designer, consultant, analyst, and workshop instructor in the field of data visualization and reproducible analysis.


## Static Visualization

![Line Chart 2](/lineplot2.jpeg 'Line Chart 2')
![Dendogram](/dendogram.png 'Dendogram')
![Sequence](/sequence.png 'Dendogram Sequence Analysis')
![Dendogram Heatmap](/dendrogramheat.jpeg 'Dendogram with Heatmap')
![Boxplot](/boxplot.jpeg 'Boxplot')
![Boxplot with stat](/boxplotstat.jpeg 'Boxplot with stat')
![Stacked Barplot](/stackedbarplot.png 'Stacked Barplot')
![Heatmap](/heatmap.jpeg 'Heatmap')
![Density Plot](/density.png 'Density Plot')
![3D Density Plot](/density3d.jpeg '3D Density Plot')
![Histogram](/histogram.jpeg 'Histogram')
![K-means Clustering](/kmeans.jpeg 'Clustering')
![Reactbale](/table.png 'Reactable')

## Animated Visualization
This is best for presentation

## Interactive Plot
You can interact with this plot by pointing your cursor to the component of the plot. This allows users to interact with graphs on display, allowing for a better storytelling experience. Zooming in and out, point value display, panning graphs, etc. Being able to navigate through your visualizations smoothly plays a huge part in communicating data. Observe how easy it is to explain complicated data by using this type of plot. Compared to a static graph, this is miles ahead.
