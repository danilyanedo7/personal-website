Ma, I stand behind the shadow of solitude for so long. My soul adrift in barren land. My heartaches echoes through a lonesome cry inside the dark well. I was surrounded by symphony of silence, no hand to be found, no friendly voice to be heard. I was lost in a crowded room longing for a warm connection, yet feeling apart as a shattered puzzle. I crawled through abyss just to unify pieces of me. I was tossed through sorrow as a solitary figure, struggling against the tide of fate. I navigated the world of despair yearning for solace, but the weight of darkness was hard to bear. Yet in your palm, ma, I discovered nothing but ultimate security. Within your palm, ma, the most bitter flower releases its sweetest pollen. Within your palm ma, the hardest rock turns into the softest sand. Within your palm, ma, the sharpest thorn blooms into blossom. 

Ma, I've fought thousands of combat against pain through tear stained nights. I walked through unending road, it's rough and long, ma. I yearned for myself above all else in the world. Gone are the days of my bravery, Ma. I no longer resemble the young knight I once was. It seems I have been defeated, and the battle with myself continues, leaving me feeling lost in the waves of uncertainty. 

Have I ever shown you that beneath my bare feet lies a tomb made off of fragile bones and intense anger. Yet, your tender kisses rebuild this tomb into a comforting home. It's a place I know I will seek when my last ember of fire dims. Within your bone home, I find solace, and your love works wonders, transforming my bitter ashes into sweet sands along a sparkling shoreline. Ma, I miss you. All I need is you. While God might have created blazing anger, darkest sorrow, and severe anguish, he also made you as his purest apology. 

Someone said that this sadness is eternal, ma. If that were the case, Ma, I would choose to face forever alongside no other soul but yours. However, I believe there is no forever, Ma. I have embarked on a quest to seek it out. I have unravelled the mistery of the universe, sat at the throne of darlings and dearests, and felt the desire burning brightly within alpha centauri, yet no forever is to be found. Nothing lasts forever, Ma.

I slept on the freezing cold ground for so long that I can't recall how it feels to be warm. But because of you ma, my overscast sky turned into the warmest sunset at the end of a long day. Ma, I'm sorry for you have given me your wings only for me to break the into parts so that I can craft mine. I sailed through rough seas, ma. But you're a sheltered harbor, where I'm led. For in your arms, ma, I found a place called peace. For in your arms, ma, I will give anything, whatever it takes to stop you witnessing my heartbreak. For in your eyes, ma, I found the sweetest dreams reflected. 

Ma, even if the last love will be disappeared tonight, I know I will always have you, the world's worries will never harm me. Rest in peace, ma!
